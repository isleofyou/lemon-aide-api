## Endpoints
  - GET `/api/v1/all-products`
  - GET `/api/v1/favorites`
  - GET `/api/v1/outfits`
  - PUT `/api/v1/favorites/:id`
  - POST `/api/v1/outfits`
  - DELETE `/api/v1/outfits/:id`

## Challenges
  - Trying to come up with a schema for our tables.
  - Trying to understand, implement, update, troubleshoot, and run migrations and seeds.
  - Not being able to see the tables with our seed information outside of the Postgres CLI. Luckily, DBeaver resolved that issue.
  - The Knex querying syntax was a bit difficult to implement at first because I didnâ€™t really understand that our query was able to return whatever columns (data) we needed. Re-reading the docs and console logging dozens of times helped resolve this issue.
  - Realizing that our teammates had to create the database and tables on their local repositories, run a migration and seed it in order for them to see what I was seeing on my end.

## Wins
  - Successfully created a backend server and database that was able to be used for our front end application.
  - Learning about databases and querying and how useful and powerful they really are for all front end applications.
  - With the exception of "PATCH", we were able to implement all of the HTTP methods.
  - Being able to sift through the Knex docs and implement querying methods as needed.
  - Deploying both the Express server and Postgres database to Heroku.
